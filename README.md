### Hello I'm Talon
I'm learning Python because I want to make games because games are cool.
I guess some games I find particularly cool are Xenoblade Chronicles, Half-Life, Fallout: New Vegas, and a bunch of others, I've been gaming since the day I was born, and I've gone through a lot of franchises.
I really just don't know much what to put here. This is probably fine, though.
